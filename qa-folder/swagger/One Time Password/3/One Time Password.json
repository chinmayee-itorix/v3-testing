In this particular API, One Time Password is exposed following this model.\nOTP: One Time password is a one-time authorization code (OTAC) that is valid for only one login session or transaction.\nAPI Functionality\nIt enables a Service Provider (SP) to send an OTP code by SMS and validate it to verify the phone number (MSISDN) as a proof of possession.\n\nResources and Operations overview\nThis API currently provides two endpoints, one to send an OTP to a given phone number and another to validate the code received as input.\n\nAuthorization and authentication\nCamara Security and Interoperability Profile provides details on how a client requests an access token.\n\nWhich specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.\n\nIt is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.\n\nTerms of service\nAPI Support - Website\nSend email to API Support\nApache 2.0\nProject documentation at CAMARA"
